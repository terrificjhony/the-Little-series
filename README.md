# the-Little-series
Some notes and code on the Little series, by *Dan Friedman*.
I'm new to functional programming and find that the **commandments** in his book is very helpful,so here, I take some excerpts from his book.

Highly recommend beginners to use his book to learn **functional programming** from scratch .
